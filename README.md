# SimpleReactJSDemo
 A simple ReactJS Demo project, in which I try to recreate the ToDo App from memory, having seen Travesty Media's React JS Crash Course once.
 It is mainly just to show that I have seen ReactJS before. I really like it though, so I think I might try to build a more in-depth and meaningful website using it.

It is really good and I would definitely suggest that you watch it if you aren't familiar with ReactJS. It is just 1.5 hours to get some insight into what is seemingly on every single ad on LinkedIn.
